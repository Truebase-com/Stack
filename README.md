# Truth Stack

This repository hosts the collection of tools and libraries that compose the Truth technology stack. Other than the Backer project, these projects do not depend on each other, and can be used independently.



## Project Inventory

**Truth** - The data modeling language that acts as the foundation for the entire stack.

**Backer** -  A tool that generates an embeddable TypeScript data management library from a body of Truth code.

**Reflex** - A fast, lightweight state management library suitable for building web user interfaces.

**Makejs** - A package of utility for creating and distributing JavaScript bundles.

**Artistry** - A series of tools (Visual Studio Code extensions and ESLint rules) that enforce the code style used throughout this code base.
